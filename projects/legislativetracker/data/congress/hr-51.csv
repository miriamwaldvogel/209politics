Date,Action,Description,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1/4/21,Introduced in the House,"H.R. 51 would add Washington D.C. as a state. D.C. has a population of roughly 700,000 people, larger than Wyoming and Vermont. D.C. is allocated three electoral votes for presidential elections, but residents do not have any representation in Congress beyond Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a non-voting delegate who can only draft legislation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1/4/21,Sponsor gave introductory remarks on the measure,"<a href=”https://statehood.dc.gov/page/why-statehood-dc”>Proponents of statehood</a> argue that D.C. residents are denied adequate Congressional representation while paying the highest federal income taxes per capita in the country. The district held a referendum to become a state in 2016, which 86% of voters supported.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1/4/21,Referred to the House Judiciary Committee,"There are various viewpoints as to the constitutionality of making D.C. a state. The Constitution mandates a federal district with a maximum size of 10 square miles. H.R. 51 proposes reducing that district down to the Capitol, the White House, the Supreme Court, and other major federal buildings. Others argue that D.C. cannot become a state without a constitutional amendment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"The idea of D.C. statehood also has a partisan angle. The district is roughly 45% Black and overwhelmingly Democratic. Adding D.C. as a state would very likely send two Democratic senators and a Democratic representative to Congress. Statehood thus has received a lot of opposition from Republicans. When the House passed a version of H.R. 51 in 2020 232-180, no Republicans voted for it. The bill then never received a vote in the Senate, which was controlled by the GOP at the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"Even with both chambers of Congress controlled by Democrats, H.R. 51’s passage is not certain. The bill has enough votes to pass the House again, but not all Senate Democrats have said they support statehood. Additionally, the Senate filibuster requires 60 votes for legislation to pass, so at least 10 Republicans would need to vote for the bill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
