1/11/21,Introduced in the House,"H.R. 40 would establish a commission to study the history of slavery in the United States and the resulting systemic racism, and recommend reparations (or “appropriate remedies'') to Congress. Support for reparations had gradually grown over the years, particularly after Ta-Nehisi Coates’ article in The Atlantic titled <a href=”https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/”>The Case for Reparations</a>. H.R. 40 was first proposed in 1989 by Rep. John Conyers (D-MI), who then reintroduced it every year until he left Congress in 2017.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
