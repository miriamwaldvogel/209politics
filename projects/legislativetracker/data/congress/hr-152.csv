Date,Action,Description,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1/4/21,Introduced in the House,"H.R. 152 would require that all mortgage payments deferred by COVID-19 would not be due to be paid back until the end of the loan, rather than the end of the deferral period. The bill would also give landlords an incentive to waive rent, extend leases until after the coronavirus emergency, and enact an eviction moratorium in exchange for a quarterly forgivable loan from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The bill, also known as the Ensuring Homeowner and Occupant Monetary Encouragement and Stability (HOMES) Act, applies to both principal and interest payments on residential mortgage loans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
