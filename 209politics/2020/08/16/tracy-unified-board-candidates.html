          <p id="p2" class="paragraph">The other two incumbents are Jill Costa, the current clerk, and Jeremy Silcox. Ms. Costa was appointed to the board in 2010 and has been reelected twice since. Mr. Silcox was appointed in January 2019 to replace board member Dan Arriola, who had been elected to Tracy City Council.</p>
          <p id="p3" class="paragraph">The challengers are behavioral health consultant Nathalia Erskine, project management director Gerald Jeffs, instructor and Kimball High School graduate Zachary Hoffert, governmental program analyst Ana Blanco, (who also serves on the board of the California Coalition Against Sexual Assault) and cybersecurity engineer Ajmer Mann. In a campaign video released last week, Mr. Jeffs said that, “It is small incremental changes that lead to sustainable improvements in our schools. There is no single solution to the disparities in education and chasing change will never end.” He is the only candidate to have publicly released any campaign materials so far.</p>
