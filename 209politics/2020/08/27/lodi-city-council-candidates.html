          <p id="p1" class="paragraph">There are two open seats on the Lodi City Council, which will be chosen separately to complete the city’s transition to by-district city council elections. Prior to 2018, city council members were elected at-large. In October 2017, the city received a letter from the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) asserting that the at-large system diluted the Latino vote in violation of the California Voting Rights Act. An ordinance was adopted in March 2018 by the city council establishing by-district elections.</p>
          <p id="p2" class="paragraph">District 4 is situated just west of Highway 99 and Lockeford Street. Most of the district is north of Highway 12 and west of Main Street. Councilmember JoAnne Mounce, who has served since 2004, is seeking this seat. She currently represents Lodi on the board of the League of California cities. Recently on city council, Mounce negotiated down the price of the city’s ongoing water meter installation from $1200 to $300 per house, launched a program to renovate alley infrastructure, and secured bus rides for Lodi students.</p>
          <p id="p3" class="paragraph">If reelected, Mounce hopes to finish ongoing infrastructure repairs, enact pension reforms (including maintaining the existing $10 million pension stabilization fund), and potentially provide free Internet access to the district. She has been endorsed by San Joaquin County Supervisors Kathy Miller and Chuck Winn and the Lodi Professional Firefighters Local 1225.</p>
          <p id="p4" class="paragraph">Ramon Yepez, a data analyst who has worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. embassy in Madrid, is also running for District 4’s spot. “Raised on the East Side, I am ready for the privilege to represent my neighborhood… District 4 has been neglected for a long time - it’s time we change that.”, per his campaign website.</p>
          <p id="p5" class="paragraph">Yepez supports many of the usual issues, including homelessness, jobs, and infrastructure. More interestingly, he has proposed the use of artificial intelligence in Lodi for things such as energy metering, training employees, analyzing security camera footage, and predicting poor air quality.</p>
          <p id="p6" class="paragraph">Also seeking the city council position is Shak Khan, a local business owner and former overseas contractor for the U.S. Department of Defense. He has primarily focused on crime and homelessness, having proposed to develop a system to deter and monitor criminal activity. Khan has also suggested increasing police patrols in gang-heavy neighborhoods and expanding substance abuse and mental health programs for the homeless.</p>
          <p id="p7" class="paragraph">The final District 4 candidate is Nati Bowman, a paralegal and nonprofit director. She has founded Partners for International Cooperation, which aids organizations in becoming nonprofits, and the Lodi-based Commons Community Center, which provides a food pantry, clothing closet, and home deliveries. Partners for International Cooperation has also funded a solar powered farm in Kenya.</p>
          <p id="p8" class="paragraph">Bowman has also served as the clerk of the Tracy Rural County Fire Protection District Board. She has proposed policies such as supporting affordable housing and local businesses, programs catered to the specific needs of homeless individuals, expanding green spaces, and expanding community mailboxes and access to municipal permits.</p>
          <p id="p9" class="paragraph">District 5 wraps east and south around District 4. Lodi Measure L Sales Tax Oversight Commissioner Mikey Hothi is one of three candidates. He has emphasized his role in securing funding for cybersecurity and cybercrime protections, roadway and waterway improvements, and Lodi Lake. In regards to the issue of homelessness, Hothi told 209 Politics that, “We need to provide shelter for our city's growing homeless population and provide law enforcement with the tools to clear these folks from the streets.”. He has also proposed increasing green space by expanding the Lodi Lake nature area northward and creating new non-vehicle routes.</p>
          <p id="p10" class="paragraph">Hothi has been endorsed by State Assemblymember Jim Cooper, who he also serves as district director to. He has also been backed by San Joaquin County Supervisors Tom Patti and Miguel Villapudua, as well as Lodi Planning Commissioner Mitch Slater.</p>
          <p id="p11" class="paragraph">Also running is Michael McKnight, a local business owner, podcast host, and Lodi High graduate.</p>
          <p id="p12" class="paragraph">The final candidate is Hector Madrigal, a student and service worker. He is also the founder of The Olive Branch, a news and politics organization.</p>
          <p id="p13" class="paragraph">“It’s time we change the system together by bringing true representation to our diverse population by enacting term limits and allowing citizens to vote in the Mayor. It’s time we bring racial justice through criminal justice reform, racial inclusion in our schools, and having the tough conversations about injustice in our community. And it’s time we as a society take mental illness seriously by creating preventative care in our system.”, Madrigal wrote on his campaign website.</p>
          <p id="p14" class="paragraph">Madrigal has voiced support for police reforms outlined by 8 Can’t Wait, which include a chokehold ban and a requirement for officers to intervene when fellow officers are using excessive force. He has also proposed a day center in which those who are homeless can receive their medication, lock up their belongings, charge their phones, and have access to social services and job training programs.</p>
          <p id="p15" class="paragraph">Incumbent city councilmember Bob Johnson will not be seeking reelection.</p>
