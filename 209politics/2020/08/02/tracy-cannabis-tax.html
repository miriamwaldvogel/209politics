          <p id="p1" class="paragraph">Among the measures for Tracy voters to consider in this November’s election will be a general tax on cannabis and hemp businesses. The proposal is expected to net between $350,000 to $750,000 in revenue for the city’s general fund. There are at least 20 cannabis businesses in the Tracy area, most of them delivery-only.</p>

          </div>
          <p id="p2" class="paragraph">An almost identical proposal, Measure D, was also up for vote in 2018 and required ⅔ approval to pass. It was defeated, with 62.2% (16,187 votes) for yes and 37.8% (9,819 votes) for no. Cannabis businesses were still prohibited from operating in Tracy at the time, although regulations were being drafted to allow two delivery-only businesses. As a result, the projected revenue was considerably smaller than the current proposal at $35,000 to $100,000 a year. Additionally, the tax income was supposed to go to police and code enforcement rather than the city’s general fund.</p>
          <p id="p3" class="paragraph">This November’s measure requires only 50% approval to go into effect, making it likely to pass. The tax rates would depend on the type of business: $12 per square foot for cultivators, 6% for retailers, 2.5% for laboratories, 3% for distributors, and 4% for all other businesses. These rates would be maximums, with the City Council able to adjust the rates as they see fit. <a href="https://www.ttownmedia.com/tracy_press/news/voters-to-decide-on-local-cannabis-tax/article_da2d9b8a-9bbd-11ea-aa26-e7cf7d32d23d.html" id="link1" class="externallink">According to the Tracy Press,</a> cannabis businesses with multiple licenses would have their tax rate capped at 15%.</p>
