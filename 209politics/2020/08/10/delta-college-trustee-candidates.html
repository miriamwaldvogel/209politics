          <p id="p1" class="paragraph">There will be four seats on the November ballot for the Delta Community College Board of Trustees, three of which have multiple candidates. The incumbent trustee for Area 1, Jennet Stebbins, is up for reelection with no challengers. Area 1 encompasses south Stockton and Weston Ranch.</p>

          </div>
          <p id="p2" class="paragraph">In Area 2, which covers central Stockton, there are three candidates including the incumbent, Van Ha To-Cowell. She has held the seat for one four-year term, and previously served on the Lincoln Unified School District Board of Trustees for eight years. Sabrina Flores-Eng, a cultural educator who unsuccessfully ran for a position on the San Joaquin County Democartic Party Central Committee back in March, is challenging her. Also on the ballot is 2017 Stocktonian of the Year Elizabeth Blanchard, who has formerly taught psychology at Delta College. She is also a former president of the California Teachers Association group at Delta.</p>
          <p id="p3" class="paragraph">The seat for Area 5, which covers east San Joaquin and part of Calaveras Counties, is a two-way race. Stephan Castellanos, who has held the position since 2008, is seeking to maintain his position. The other candidate is Stockton Unified School District Board of Education President Kathleen Garcia, who also launched an unsuccessful campaign for State Senate (CA-5) in March.</p>
          <p id="p4" class="paragraph">The final position up for contest in November is Area 6 (Tracy and Mountain House). Once again, the incumbent, Teresa Brown, is running to retain the seat. She has also served as program developer for CSU Stanislaus’ Stockton Center University Extended Education. Casey Goodall, former Associate Superintendent of Business Services of Tracy Unified School District, is also running.</p>
          <p id="p5" class="paragraph">This article will be updated as candidates respond to requests for comment.</p>
