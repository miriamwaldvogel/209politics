          <p id="p1" class="paragraph">There will be four seats on the November ballot for the Delta Community College Board of Trustees, three of which have multiple candidates. The incumbent trustee for Area 1, Jennet Stebbins, is up for reelection with no challengers. Area 1 encompasses south Stockton and Weston Ranch.</p>

          </div>
          <p id="p2" class="paragraph">In Area 2, which covers central Stockton, there are three candidates including the incumbent, Van-Ha To-Cowell. She has held the seat for one four-year term, and previously served on the Lincoln Unified School District Board of Trustees for eight years. Ms. To-Cowell’s key issues include campus safety and student leadership opportunities.</p>
          <p id="p3" class="paragraph">Sabrina Flores-Eng, a cultural educator who unsuccessfully ran for a position on the San Joaquin County Democartic Party Central Committee back in March, is challenging her.</p>
          <p id="p4" class="paragraph">Also on the ballot is 2017 Stocktonian of the Year Elizabeth Blanchard, who taught psychology at Delta College for 35 years. She is also a former president of the California Teachers Association group at Delta. According to her campaign statement, Dr. Blanchard hopes to focus on “technical and vocational training programs so students can go directly into the workforce and get family-wage jobs, while preparing others for transfer to colleges and universities.”</p>
          <p id="p5" class="paragraph">The seat for Area 5, which covers east San Joaquin and part of Calaveras Counties, is a two-way race. Stephan Castellanos, who has held the position since 2008, is seeking to maintain his position. He has been endorsed by San Joaquin County Supervisor Kathy Miller, State Assemblymember Susan Eggman, and Calaveras County Supervisor Jack Garamendi.</p>
          <p id="p6" class="paragraph">The other candidate is Stockton Unified School District Board of Education President Kathleen Garcia, who also launched an unsuccessful campaign for State Senate (CA-5) in March. She has also previously served as an elected delegate to the California School Board Association. Ms. Garcia has named education and safety as key issues for Delta.</p>
          <p id="p7" class="paragraph">The final position up for contest in November is Area 6 (Tracy and Mountain House). Once again, the incumbent, Teresa Brown, is running to retain the seat she has held since 2008. She has also served as a member of the Advisory Committee on Education Services of the Community College League of California for ten years. Ms. Brown wrote that “Student success and meeting the needs of community employers relies on a Board that sets sound policy, maintains strong fiscal accountability, and insures [sic] access, equity, and inclusion for all.”</p>
          <p id="p8" class="paragraph">Casey Goodall, former Associate Superintendent of Business Services of Tracy Unified School District and member of the US Navy, is also running. Mr. Goodall wrote in his campaign statement that, “many graduating high school students or adults… overlook the affordable first-class learning experience Delta provides. We must remedy that.”. He also touted his experience teaching School District Budgeting at the University of Southern California, promising “strong fiscal oversight for our budget.”</p>
