          <p id="p2" class="paragraph">Area 2 is predominantly composed of the Brookside neighborhood north of March Lane. The two candidates are Garland Frazier, a community associate, and Ashley Jones, a parent and HR manager for a nonprofit early childhood education program.</p>
          <p id="p3" class="paragraph">In her campaign statement, Ms. Jones highlighted her experience in human resources and how it taught her to “facilitate change in an educational environment. She also wrote, “my education and professional growth has given me the foundation to represent our district through effective leadership, ethical practices, and cultural effectiveness to promote diversity and inclusion when educating our children.”</p>
          <p id="p4" class="paragraph">The other seat represents Brookside south of March and extends east to Pacific Avenue. Former Lincoln Unified teacher and educational business owner Deeann Moore Antonini is seeking the seat. She wrote in her campaign statement, “As a business owner, I have experience managing staff, working with budgets, negotiating contracts as well as navigating state and federal regulations in the educational system.”</p>
          <p id="p5" class="paragraph">Also running for the position is Sandra Chan, a Lincoln Unified parent and member of the board of directors of the Stockton Children’s Museum. “I promise to ask the tough questions and demand thorough and transparent answers… Now more than ever, we need strong leadership willing to listen, communicate, and pivot with evolving realities.”, she wrote in her candidate statement.</p>
