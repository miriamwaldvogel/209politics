          <p id="p1" class="paragraph">Three of the seven Lodi Unified School District Board of Education seats are up for vote this November. All three incumbents are seeking reelection and have at least one challenger.</p>

          <p id="p2" class="paragraph">Area 2, which is responsible for Bear Creek High School, Christa McAuliffe MIddle School, Elkhorn School, and Creekside, Julia Morgan, John Muir, and Manlio Silva Elementary Schools, has three candidates. Current board member Gary Knackstedt is running primarily on the strength of his past accomplishments, including advocacy for Career and Technical Education courses at Valley Robotics Academy, the completion of athletic construction projects at Lodi High School, and participation in employee contract negotiations. Mr. Knackstedt has served as president and vice president of the board over the past four years.</p>
          <p id="p3" class="paragraph">Running against him is former Delta College Board of Trustees President Richard Vasquez, who served in that position from 2014-2018. He has not yet responded to requests for comment on issues.</p>
          <p id="p4" class="paragraph">Area 6 serves McNair High School and Clairmont, Ellerth Larson, George Lincoln Mosher, and Westword Elementary Schools. Incumbent Ron Freitas is current vice president and former president of the board. His campaign statement touted his accomplishments in lowering class sizes, limiting suspensions, increasing graduation rates, and implementing advanced academic programs.</p>
          <p id="p4" class="paragraph">Christopher Pack, an information system analyst, is challenging Mr. Freitas. Another candidate, Tokay High School graduate Luke Joseph Price, also filed to run for the position but did not qualify.</p>
          <p id="p4" class="paragraph">The final area, Area 7, encompasses Plaza Robles High School, Delta Sierra Middle School, and Oakwood, Parkline, Sutherland, and Wagner-Holt Elementary Schools. Joe Nava, the current officeholder, is right now the president of the Lodi Unified School District Board. He has held the position since 2008.</p>
          <p id="p4" class="paragraph">Parent Jessica Mitchell and health care executive Juan Troy are also in the running, though neither have released a campaign statement. Kelley Marable, who worked with the Lodi Unified Superintendents’ Advisory Committee for six years, is also seeking the seat. Ms. Marable wrote in her campaign statement that, “When it comes to getting the job done, and facing new challenges she continually exhibits a tremendous amount of drive towards accomplishing goals with fair, and creative solutions.”</p>
          <p id="p4" class="paragraph">This article will be updated as candidates respond to requests for comment.</p>
