          <p id="p1" class="paragraph">On Tuesday, the Stockton City Council approved $100,000 of
            federal grants to the Stockton Fire Department to purchase
            personal protective equipment and other supplies to combat
            the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The money was awarded by
            the Federal Emergency Management Agency(FEMA) on July 1st
            and comes as cases in San Joaquin County continue to climb.
            248 new cases were reported in the county yesterday for a
            total of 11,209 confirmed cases.</p>

          </div>
          <p id="p2" class="paragraph">The grant money is part of FEMA’s 2020 Assistance
            to Firefighters Grant(AFG) program, authorized by the $2.2
            trillion federal relief package known as the CARES Act. The
            CARES Act also includes the Paycheck Protection Program,
            which provides loans for businesses to keep paying their
            workers, and $1200 stimulus checks sent to most Americans.
            AFG has awarded money to many major California cities,
            including Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco, San Diego.
            Several counties, including Fresno, Orange, and Kern, have
            also obtained funding from the program.</p>
          <p id="p3" class="paragraph">San Joaquin County is currently on Governor Gavin
            Newsom’s COVID-19 watchlist for COVID-19, which limits the
            reopening of businesses, schools, and other entities. There
            have been 3,707 new cases in the county over the past two
            weeks, for a ratio of 506 per 100,000 people. State
            guidelines recommend that the ratio of new cases by less
            than 100 per 100,000 before reopening can continue. San
            Joaquin County does not meet the state standard for
            available intensive care unit beds (more than 20% of
            capacity) to be taken off the watchlist. The county’s rate
            of positive tests is approximately 17.0%, more than double
            of the statewide rate of 7.5%.</p>
          <p id="p4" class="paragraph">Aside from the money from FEMA, San Joaquin also
            received $52 million (to be shared among seven other
            counties in the Central Valley) from Newsom to bolster
            testing and supplies. Three so-called coronavirus strike
            teams are also being deployed to the eight counties to
            coordinate with local officials and community groups. The
            Stockton City Council also allocated $10,000 to the fire
            department to fulfill FEMA’s requirement that the city must
            match the grant money by 10%.</p>
