        <p class="purpose about english">We seek to empower Indonesian women by offering them sewing courses.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="desc about english">The purpose of the foundation is to help underprivileged women through sewing. Numerous courses have been offered throughout Indonesia. They usually last three months and involve twenty students at the most. The students are provided with modern sewing machines, which they buy through micro-credit contract after successful completion of the course. Local teachers are selected by the foundation. They follow a predetermined set of topics that range from basic sewing skills(dresses, pants) to marketing. Our vision is to empower women of various religious and ethnic backgrounds by giving them lasting professional skills in Indonesia and elsewhere.</p>
