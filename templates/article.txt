San Joaquin County has hit a turnout level of 74.3%, with almost 272,000 ballots counted. As of Monday night, roughly 7,550 ballots still need to be processed. 6,300 of these are provisional ballots, and the rest are damaged ballots that need to be duplicated.
	There is also the possibility of ballot curing. Some vote-by-mail ballots are rejected every election by the county registrar, typically because the signature does not adequately match the signature on the voter’s driver license or state ID.
The registrar should have already contacted voters who had their ballots rejected with either a signature verification form or an unsigned ballot statement. In San Joaquin, voters have until 5 p.m. on December 1 to fix their ballot.
Teresa Brown’s lead over Casey Goodall for Area 6 of the Delta College Board continued to shrink. Brown led on election night by more than 2,000 votes. After the Monday night update, the margin between her and Goodall was 486 votes (roughly one percentage points). Turnout in the race, at almost 78%, is already high.
In State Assembly District 13, Carlos Villapudua widened his advantage over Kathy Miller to 3,705 votes, a lead of almost 2.5 percentage points. He currently has 76,800 votes (51.2%) to Miller’s 73,100 (48.8%). After winning the March primary by 4 points, Villapudua overtook Miller on Friday night by a margin of a few hundred votes.
	Robert Rickman took the lead over Rhodesia Ransom in the race for District 5 on the San Joaquin County Board of Supervisors, 32,223 votes (50.4%) to 31,700 votes (49.6%). Ransom initially led on election night by almost 3,000 votes. As of Monday night, Rickman led by 516 votes, or 0.8 points.
	The race for one spot on the Ripon Fire Board is still very close. Three seats, all elected at-large, are open on the board this cycle. Ryan Mackey and Larry Madoski are firmly in first and second place, but the gap between Matt Cultrera and Sheri Coburn for the third spot is just 18 votes.
Cultrera is currently leading with 3,752 votes (19.4%), and has led since election night. Coburn has 3,734 votes (19.3%). Almost 10,000 ballots have already been cast in the race, for a turnout of 84.4%.
