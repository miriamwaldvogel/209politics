Case Rate Stagnates, but County's Outlook is Improving
San Joaquin County reported 11.2 COVID-19 daily cases per 100,000 people this week, with a 4.4% test positivity rate and a 4.2% health equity rate. The county’s case rate, which remains too high for the red tier, saw little change from last week’s rate of 11.6 per 100,000.
	San Joaquin has to maintain a case rate of below seven, along with test positivity and a health equity metric below 8%, for at least two weeks in order to move to red. As with the last several weeks, it is still in the purple tier.
	As of Tuesday morning, 14.7% (112,000) of the county’s residents have received at least one dose, with 6.3% (48,000) having received two. Statewide, roughly 18.7% of the population has gotten at least one shot, and 8.7% are fully vaccinated.
	There has also been some friction between the county and Blue Shield, the state’s new vaccination provider. Supervisor Tom Patti called the health care giant’s takeover a “power grab” and asked during a recent meeting that the county look into ways to challenge the insurer.
	Some school districts have begun the process of reopening, with Tracy and Lincoln Unified having recently announced plans to send younger students back. Once San Joaquin reaches the red tier, students of all ages are allowed to return to in-person classes.
	A number of counties moved from the purple to the red tier this week, including Alameda, Imperial, and Santa Cruz. Roughly 20% of California residents are currently in the red tier.
Alpine County also became the first to reach the yellow tier, the lowest out of the four. Three other rural counties (Plumas, Mariposa, and Sierra) are currently in the orange tier.
