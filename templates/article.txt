The San Joaquin County Board of Supervisors met on Tuesday for their bimonthly meeting. During the meeting, the board voted to allocate $2.8 million of funding from the state’s Homeless Housing Assistance Program (HHAP) to four low-barrier projects, three for shelters and one for youth. The city of Stockton and the San Joaquin Continuum of Care also received money from the program, $6.4 million and $3.1 million respectively.
San Joaquin Behavioral Health Services received $1.14 million, the largest allocation out of the four projects, to build a 16-bed shelter for seriously mentally ill men in French Camp. The shelter, which is projected to be completed in October 2022, will accommodate individuals for up to six months.
$972,000 went to the Stockton Shelter for the Homeless. The money will be used for a three-level shipping container shelter with 46 beds, along with a full-service shelter with a navigation center. This project is expected to be finished in October 2021.
The city of Tracy was allocated $329,000 for a 30-bed Sprung Structure shelter with case management and employment services, to be finished in the winter of 2021.
Lutheran Social Services received $230,000, as part of the state’s requirement that at least 8% of HHAP funding is dedicated towards serving homeless youth. The funding will be used for a project to provide rental assistance, housing placement, and supportive services for 36 youth from 18-24 years. The program is supposed to begin as soon as the organization receives money.
The remaining $201,000 has been directed towards administration. The county has until June 30, 2025 to use its HHAP funds.
The county received applications for 34 different projects, for a total of $38.9 million. A seven-member committee then reviewed and scored the proposals. A second committee also went through the shelter-related applications and recommended four for funding.
