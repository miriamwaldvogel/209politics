During the meeting of the San Joaquin County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday, the board discussed a temporary countywide ordinance regulating third-party food delivery services such as Doordash and Uber Eats. The ordinance would have capped delivery fees at 15% and pickup fees at 10%, while prohibiting the services from reducing driver pay as a result. Services would have also been required to provide customers with an itemized list of fees and charges.
	The use of such platforms has rapidly expanded during the pandemic, as in-restaurant dining has been limited due to COVID-19 restrictions. However, services also usually collect 15% to 30% of an order in fees, reducing the bottom line of already-struggling businesses. Many major cities, including San Francisco and Los Angeles, have established ordinances limiting delivery fees since the beginning of the pandemic.
	The board elected to have a similar ordinance brought before them at a future meeting. A draft of an ordinance was included with the boardâ€™s agenda packet, but County Counsel J. Mark Myles said that it still needed to be revised and publicly posted before it could be adopted.
	Supervisor Kathy Miller also requested that a 30-day review be added to the ordinance to assess any adverse effects from its implementation, such as a significant reduction in the availability of delivery services or a price increase for consumers.
