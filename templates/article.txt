Approximately 75,500 people in San Joaquin have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, comprising almost 10% of the county’s population. Out of those people, 29,300 have also received their second shot, for a total of nearly 104,800 doses administered.
Like the rest of the state, San Joaquin is in Phases 1A and 1B of its rollout, which include healthcare workers, long-term care residents, individuals 65 and older, and workers in food, education, and emergency services. Eligibility is set to expand on March 15 to people under 65 who have underlying health conditions.
The county office of education began vaccinating teachers last week, boosting the possibility of a return to in-person classes. Other vaccine events have targeted veterans and homeless shelter residents.
But despite having 10% of its residents vaccinated, San Joaquin is still lagging behind the state average. As of Thursday, 14.3% of Californians have received at least one dose.
In fact, many of the counties in the Central Valley have had slower vaccine distributions. Kings County, for example, has administered the fewest doses per capita in the state. Some officials have been trying to correct this disparity, with Gov. Gavin Newsom announcing on Monday that vaccine allocations to the Valley would be increased by 58%.
Newsom also said that the state would be partnering with health care organization OptumServe to open up 11 vaccination sites in the region.
Rep. Josh Harder (D, CA-10), whose district covers most of southern San Joaquin, has also petitioned the federal government to expand coronavirus testing and vaccines in the Central Valley, particularly for agricultural workers.
But despite a slower-than-average vaccine rollout, San Joaquin’s numbers have declined significantly. The county’s test positivity rate is now below the threshold to enter the red tier, and its current daily case rate per 100,000 people of 17.1 is a drop of more than 30% from last week’s rate of 25.1.
