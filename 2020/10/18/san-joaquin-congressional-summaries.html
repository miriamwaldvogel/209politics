          </div>
          <p id="p1" class="paragraph">Incumbent Representatives Jerry McNerney and Josh Harder both outraised and outspent their Republican opponents by wide margins according to campaign finance filings for the period of July 1 to September 30. McNerney and Harder are both Democrats.</p>
          <p id="p2" class="paragraph">McNerney has represented California’s 9th congressional district, which covers Stockton, Lodi, Lathrop, and parts of Manteca and Escalon, since 2007. He raised $206,000 from July 1 to September 30, almost $125,000 of which came from individuals.</p>
          <p id="p3" class="paragraph">The rest came from committees, the largest donors out of that group being the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the Blue Shield of California PAC. They gave $5,000 each. McNerney spent more than $211,000 in the same period, giving him a final balance of roughly $484,000.</p>
          <p id="p4" class="paragraph">McNerney’s opponent, Antonio Amador, raised $15,325, all in donations from individuals. Amador spent roughly $14,500, finishing on September 30 with slightly less than $9,000 in the bank.</p>
          <p id="p5" class="paragraph">Amador is currently in his third race for McNerney’s seat. The closest he came to winning was in 2014, when he obtained 47.6% of the vote to McNerney’s 52.4%. As of September 4, 45.5% of the district’s voters were Democrats, while 27.2% were Republicans.</p>
          <p id="p6" class="paragraph">Harder also outraised his opponent, Ted Howze, but not by quite as wide of a margin as McNerney. He pulled in $1.36 million from July 1 to September 30, including almost $129,000 in transfers from authorized committees and roughly $98,000 from other committees. The rest, totaling $1.1 million, came from individuals.</p>
          <p id="p7" class="paragraph">Harder received almost $68,000 from the Harder 2020 Victory Fund, which according to Federal Election Committee Filings is based in Raleigh, North Carolina. Other major donors included Hold the House Victory Fund ($50,000) and Problem Solver Democrats (roughly $11,500). He spent around $1.18 million for an ending balance of $4.57 million.</p>
          <p id="p8" class="paragraph">Howze took in $343,000 almost entirely from individuals. He spent almost $399,000 for a final balance of $92,000. Howze’s campaign has also taken out extensive loans, with $245,000 still owned on September 30. This was after $105,000 in repayments were made, starting July 1.</p>
          <p id="p9" class="paragraph">Howze is making his first run for Congress. Harder won the seat in District 10 two years ago, unseating four-term congressman Jeff Denham. The district covers Ripon, Modesto, Ceres, Patterson, Turlock, and parts of Escalon and Manteca, and has a much tighter race than District 9. Roughly 39.1% of voters are Democrats, while 34.5% are Republican.</p>
