            <p id="img1caption" class="caption">From left to right: Charlie Halford, Mike Morowit, and Ron Freitas all filed their first pre-election campaign finance summary today.</p>
            <p id="img1credit" class="credit">Manteca Bulletin/Lodi News Sentinel/sjafca.com</p>
          </div>
          <p id="p2" class="paragraph">Retired police chief Charlie Halford, who is running for Manteca City Council, filed his forms today. He recorded almost $16,000 in contributions, $3,000 of which were loans from himself and another Manteca resident. Halford has already spent almost $14,000, the majority of which went to mailers and yard signs. This left him with a net balance for the period of slightly less than $2,000.</p>
          <p id="p3" class="paragraph">As of September 21, Halford was neck and neck with incumbent Debbie Moorhead in terms of total contributions over $1,000 (which are considered “large”), with $10,000 each. Moorhead has not yet filed her summary, so it will remain to be seen how the two stack up in terms of small fundraising and expenditures.</p>
          <p id="p4" class="paragraph">The other council incumbent, Gary Singh, is leading both of them with $19,000 in large donations. SIngh also already has around $700 in his campaign balance left over from the last filing period (January 1 to June 30).</p>
          <p id="p5" class="paragraph">Mike Morowit, a former Manteca city councilmember who is running for District 7 of the Manteca Unified School District Board of Education, also disclosed his summary today. Morowit took in approximately $10,500 in contributions, around $6,200 of which was spent. The influx included a $2,000 loan from Morowit to his campaign. Like Halford, most of the money went towards candidate literature. Morowit had almost $4,300 in the bank as of September 19.</p>
          <p id="p6" class="paragraph">Morowit has been by far the most active in the Manteca Unified races in terms of fundraising. No other candidate has disclosed any donations over $1,000.</p>
          <p id="p7" class="paragraph">The final candidate to have disclosed summary information is current Lodi Unified trustee Ron Freitas, who is seeking to retain his seat. Freitas took in more than $11,000 and spent roughly $6,100, leaving him with a net balance of almost $5,000.</p>
          <p id="p8" class="paragraph">Unlike Halford and Morowit, the bulk of Freitas’ fundraising came from just a couple of donors. Freitas received $5,000 each from the San Joaquin County Deputy Sheriffs Association and the Stockton Police Officers Association. He had worked with both law enforcement groups as a deputy San Joaquin district attorney for roughly 30 years.</p>
