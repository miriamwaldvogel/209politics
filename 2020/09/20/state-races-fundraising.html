          <p id="p1" class="paragraph">The fundraising gaps within San Joaquin County’s State Senate and Assembly races continued to grow this week, except for Assembly District 13. Several organizations over the course of the past seven days made large contributions to multiple candidates, often over party lines.</p>
          <p id="p2" class="paragraph">Assemblymember Susan Eggman, who is running for State Senate District 5, continued to outpace opponent Jim Ridenour, with more than $25,000 raised this week. Ridenour has not had any large donations (those over $1,000) since August 24, and has accumulated only $3,000.</p>
          <p id="p3" class="paragraph">Eggman received an in-kind contribution of more than $11,000 from the California Democratic Party on September 15. In-kind contributions are for when goods or services are offered to a candidate at a reduced fee, or when someone else pays for services on a candidate’s behalf.</p>
          <p id="p4" class="paragraph">Other major donors to her campaign this week included the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians ($2,500), Smile Direct Club ($4,700), and the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation ($4,000). Eggman also received $1,000 from Representative Josh Harder (D, CA-10), who endorsed her campaign on September 9.</p>
          <p id="p5" class="paragraph">Assemblymember Jim Cooper, who is seeking to retain his District 9 seat, also continued to put distance between himself and opposing candidate Eric Rigard. Like Eggman, Cooper also received money from the Yocha Dente Nation, albeit $4,700 instead of $4,000. The tribe is located in Yolo County, roughly 33 northwest of Davis.</p>
          <p id="p6" class="paragraph">The Smile Direct Club also donated $3,000 to Cooper’s campaign. The company is currently based in Nashville, Tennessee, and makes clear teeth aligners. Californians for Jobs and Strong Economy, San Francisco real estate executive Alexander Dean Jr., and Western Manufactured Housing Communities Association PAC contributed $4,700 each to Cooper. His campaign pulled in a total of almost $34,000 this week.</p>
          <p id="p7" class="paragraph">Rigard has not yet recorded any contributions over $1,000 for the November election.</p>
          <p id="p8" class="paragraph">In District 12, current assemblymember Heath Flora also received contributions from Smile Direct Club and the Yocha Dehe Nation, $4,700 and $4,000 respectively. Gilead Sciences ($2,500), Johnson & Johnson ($2,500), and the Western Manufactured Housing Communities Association ($2,000) also donated.</p>
          <p id="p9" class="paragraph">Flora’s opponent, Lathrop city councilmember Paul Akinjo, has not yet disclosed any campaign finance data.</p>
          <p id="p10" class="paragraph">Carlos Villapudua actually gained ground this week against Kathy Miller in Assembly District 13. Miller has not received any large donations since September 12, while Villapudua accumulated almost $26,000.</p>
          <p id="p11" class="paragraph">Like with Eggman, Cooper, and Flora, the Yocha Dehe Nation also donated to Villapudua, this contribution totaling $4,500. Villapudua also received $9,300 from the California Association of Highway Patrolmen, $4,700 from the California Correctional Peace Officers Association, and $4,650 from the California Teachers Association for Better Citizenship.</p>
